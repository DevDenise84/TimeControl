# TimeControl
Summary of the project and what problem it was solving:
My project implements a 12 and 24-hour format clock simulation in C++ to demonstrate time management in different formats programmatically.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I effectively implemented functions for time manipulation, formatting, and user interaction, making the code structured and easy to follow.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have improved the input validation in the getMenuChoice function which would enhance the user experience and prevent unexpected behavior.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Formatting time in different formats was challenging, but I believe I successfully used conditional statements and string manipulation. Online C++ documentation was a helpful resource.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
The project enhances skills in data manipulation, user interaction, and time management, which are transferable to other programming projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used clear function names, comments, and modular code structure ensures readability and maintainability. Adding error handling and input validation would have improved adaptability and robustness.
